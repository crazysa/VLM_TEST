## 💻 System Requirements

### Minimum (for experimentation)
- Python 3.8+
- 8GB RAM
- 8GB GPU VRAM (or use 4-bit quantization)
- Internet connection

### Recommended
- Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11
- 16GB RAM
- 16GB GPU VRAM

## 🔧 Common Setup Issues

### Out of Memory
```python
# Edit config.py
self.load_in_4bit = True
self.batch_size = 1
```

### Slow Download
First model download takes 5-10 minutes. Be patient!
Models are cached - subsequent loads are instant.

### Import Errors
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```
